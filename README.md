
At the moment, this is just a little proof of context, derived from Tristam MacDonald's
code http://swiftcoder.wordpress.com/2008/12/19/simple-glsl-wrapper-for-pyglet/

This requires the current version of pyglet (1.4) found at

hg clone https://code.google.com/p/pyglet/

It also requires pyeuclid for maths, to be found here..

https://github.com/ezag/pyeuclid

..and simpului, to be found here..

..happy hacking!

This uses a compatibility profile, because some old calls are hard-coded into Pyglet.

This makes me sad :-(
