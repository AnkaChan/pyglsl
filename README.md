
At the moment, this is just a little proof of context, derived from Tristam MacDonald's
code http://swiftcoder.wordpress.com/2008/12/19/simple-glsl-wrapper-for-pyglet/

This requires the source version of pyglet, found at..

hg clone https://code.google.com/p/pyglet/

..It also requires pyeuclid for maths, to be found here..
